Pixel-Knight
============
Pixel Knight is a desktop platformer game much like recent titles such as Shovel Knight or even old ones like super mario world.
Pixel Knight follows the tale of a lone knight in search of adventure in the Iben Peninsula, and features numerous enemies, levels,
and puzzles. 

As a computer game, Pixel Knight is operated through the use of arrow keys, the keyboard, and the mouse/trackpad, 
although some of the settings can be changed in game. Arrow keys are used in the title and over world screen, while the 
mouse/trackpad is used in option screens and the controls screen. In-game controls are entirely modifiable, although the default 
controls use the WASD setup in addition to the left, right, and middle mouse buttons. 

The game was made through use of the java engine Libgdx, but still mostly operates upon the principles of java. 

The code should be quite easy to read and understand, as long as the reader has a strong grasp of the java language and Libgdx.
